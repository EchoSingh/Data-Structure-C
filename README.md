## Introduction

Welcome to the C Data Structures repository! This project is aimed at self-learning data structures in the C programming language. Each data structure is implemented in its own file within the `src` directory.

Feel free to explore the code, learn from the implementations, and use them as a reference for your own projects.

## Data Structures

Here's a list of data structures implemented in this repository:

1. **Linked List**
   - File: `src/linkedlist.c`

2. **Stack**
   - File: `src/stack.c`

3. **Queue**
   - File: `src/queue.c`

<!-- Add more data structures as you implement them -->

## How to Use

To use these data structures in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EchoSingh/C-DataStructures.git
